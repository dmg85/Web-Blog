            <h2>HTML</h2>
            <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the most basic building block of the
                Web. It defines the meaning and structure of web content. Other technologies
                besides HTML are generally used to describe a web page's appearance/presentation
                (CSS) or functionality/behavior (JavaScript).</p>

        <div id="Basics">
            <h2>Starting with the basics</h2>
            <p>One way many people start learning to code is by picking a popular
                programming language and jumping in head first with no direction.
                This could take the form of an online coding course, a tutorial
                project,or a random book purchase on a specific topic.</p>
            <p>JavaScript is versatile and beginner-friendly. With more experience,
                you'll be able to create games, animated 2D and 3D graphics, comprehensive
                database-driven apps, and much more!</p>
